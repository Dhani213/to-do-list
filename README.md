📝 Simple Todo List App

Hi! 👋
This is a simple Todo List web app I built while learning JavaScript.

As a first-year college student, I wanted to strengthen my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and how data can be stored in the browser. This project helped me connect theory with practical implementation.

🚀 What This App Can Do

Add new tasks

Set due dates

Delete tasks

Automatically save tasks using localStorage

Persist data even after refreshing the page

🛠 Tech Used

HTML5

CSS3 (Grid Layout)

JavaScript (ES6)

Browser LocalStorage API

💡 What I Learned

While building this project, I practiced:

DOM manipulation

Event handling

Event delegation

Working with arrays & objects

Storing and retrieving data using localStorage

Writing cleaner and more structured JavaScript

This project helped me understand how small applications manage state and update UI dynamically.

🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted to move beyond just watching tutorials and actually build something on my own. This Todo App may be simple, but it represents my progress and growing confidence in frontend development.
